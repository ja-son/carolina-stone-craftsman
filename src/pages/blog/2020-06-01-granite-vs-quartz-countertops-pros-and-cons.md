**What exactly are these two materials?**\
We will start by clearly defining the difference between granite and quartz.

* **Granite-** it’s a natural stone formed after the occurrence of cooling magma. We retrieve granite from stone quarries through mining, and later they are transferred to industries where they are slashed into thin slabs, fabricated and polished into the final product that sits on your kitchen countertops. Granite comes in a wide variety of colors, depending on your tastes and preferences.
* **Quartz-** it is commonly referred to as an engineered stone. Quartz countertops are mainly manufactured from naturally occurring and crushed quartz mixed with resin as a bonding agent and added pigment for color. Typically, quartz countertops are composed of 95% crushed natural quartz and 5% polymer resins.

**Granite vs quartz countertops pros and cons**\
Now that we have a more precise understanding of these two materials, let’s quickly dig into their pros and cons to help you know what you are about to get yourself into.

## Granite

### Pros

**More natural appearance**\
One pro that granite has over quartz, and every other engineered stone is its unique mineral pattern, composition, and color. You are likely to have a very unique and attractive countertop if you pick granite. They also have a natural appeal coming from its origin.\
\
**Wide range of colors**\
Granite countertops come in hundreds of shades and colors. They are undoubtedly unique and beautiful to look at. Many of our clients have stated that the imperfections within granite countertops make it distinctive.\
\
**Durability**\
On the question of durability, granite countertops have a long lifespan when correctly sealed by professionals. Correctly sealed granite countertops don’t soak up liquids and are stain-resistant.\
\
**Wide range pricing**\
This probably caught you by surprise. Entry-level granite can cost you anywhere from $30 to $60 per square foot. These figures are significantly lower than most quartz countertops.\
\
**Suitable for outdoor use**\
Due to its natural composition, granite is built to withstand natural elements such as sunlight. It will serve you for ages without fading or discoloring when exposed to the sun.

### Cons

**Absorbent and porous nature**\
As earlier highlighted, granite countertops require top-notch experience and skills to seal the surface correctly. If left inadequately sealed or unsealed, the granite countertops could absorb juice, oil, and other liquids that stain and are hard to eradicate.\
\
**High maintenance**\
This con is probably the biggest winner for quartz in the debate on quartz vs granite countertops. Granite requires more care compared to quartz. Broken seal from using harsh cleaning chemicals can subject the granite countertop to be porous. This makes it vulnerable to stain, harboring bacteria, and other damages. We recommend resealing your granite countertops at least every three to five years.\
\
**You can’t bag a clean style with granite**\
Again, quartz vs granite countertops bring to us the subject of personal taste and preferences. Granite carries a lot of speckles, spots, and veins in various colors, making it impossible to have it in a clean and simple style without patterns. If you are looking for something that’s not too busy, granite countertops shouldn’t be an option.

## Quartz

### Pros

**Low maintenance**\
Quartz is a low maintenance material that doesn’t require special cleaning techniques and detergents to maintain its glow and durability unlike, granite. All it takes is water and ordinary soap to eliminate stains and spills. Quartz countertops don’t need the extra sealing and resealing. Once installed, you are good to go.\
\
**Get it in simple and clean colors**\
We encourage clients looking for more consistent and clean colors to go for quartz options when debating between quartz countertops vs granite. Its engineered nature makes it possible to manufacture more consistent colors that make it a better fit in contemporary kitchens and bathrooms.\
\
**Stronger material**\
We understand that it may be a little hard to believe, but quartz countertops are heftier compared to granite. What are we saying? Your quartz countertop is likely to withstand anything thrown at it, including hot pans, as its more resistant to chipping and cracking. The strong bonds within the quartz countertops aren’t easy to break because of the polymers and resins used during manufacture. Not much about strength can be said about granite.

### Cons
**Not unique**\
Unfortunately, if you have a knack for unique staff, quartz countertops won’t give you that. Quartz slabs typically look the same, unlike granite countertops that offer a wide variety of patterns and colors. You can predict the type of quartz slabs anyone will present to you at the store.\
\
**Not suitable for outdoor use**\
Quartz countertops have a lower hand when looking for outdoor installations. The material struggles to perform when outdoor despite being heat resistant. The surface is bound to discolor and fade over time when exposed to sunlight.\
\
**Pricier**\
When compared to granite, quartz countertops a little pricier. This is probably because quartz is human-made, and its pricing depends on the manufacturer and the market forces.\
\
There you have it! An in-depth analysis of quartz countertops vs granite. In general, both materials are ideal options for countertops. The right pick for you depends on your tastes, preferences, and needs. A professional might guide you through the process, while factoring in both of their cons and pros.
