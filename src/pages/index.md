        Granite's natural beauty along with its durability
        and low maintenance makes it a popular choice of stone. When sealed, 
        granite is more resistant to stains and bacteria than laminte, tile, or
        concrete. Choosing granite counters will save you money over time and
        add elegance to any kitchen or bath room.
