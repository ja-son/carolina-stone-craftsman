        Granite's natural beauty along with its durability, resistance to heat,
        and low maintenance makes it a popular choice of stone. When sealed, 
        granite is more resistant to stains and bacteria than laminte, tile, or
        concrete. Choosing granite counters will save you money over time and
        add elegance to any kitchen or bath room.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
